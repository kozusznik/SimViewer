/**
 * Operates on a given file that consists of messages that could be normally
 * transferred over the network but were instead saved into this file.
 * Owing to this class, the messages can be extracted from the file, and
 * be processed with the NetMessagesProcessor to update the SimViewer's
 * displayed content. This way, a simulation can be replayed (even backwards!)
 * provided the file's content shows a history of some simulation -- in
 * which case the individual time points are separated with the "tick"
 * messages.
 *
 * The class's API is synchronized on this object so multiple callers may
 * operate (request to replay previous or next time point) on this object.
 *
 * Most of the API here may throw InterruptedException which is because all
 * the code here boils down to calling NetMessagesProcessor's processMsg(),
 * which may want to wait a little while under some circumstances and may
 * get interrupted while doing so -- this gets propagated upstream.
 *
 * This file was created and is being developed by Vladimir Ulman, 2019.
