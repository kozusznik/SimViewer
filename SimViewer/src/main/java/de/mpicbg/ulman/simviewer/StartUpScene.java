/**
 * Opens the scenery window, starts the listening server, maintains
 * lightweight vector-graphics representation of cells and force vectors
 * acting on them, and maintains history of this representation (so that
 * the evolution of the population can be re-played).
 *
 * There will be a couple of threads:
 * - one to host SceneryBase.main() -- the loop that governs the display,
 *   and displays from data structures
 * - one to interact on console with the user to control Scenery
 * - one to host the ZeroMQ server to listen for stuff,
 *   and update the data structures
 *
 * Adapted from TexturedCubeJavaExample.java from the scenery project,
 * originally created by kharrington on 7/6/16.
