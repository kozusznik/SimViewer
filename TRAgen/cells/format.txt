where:
Each term represents a floating-point number. In the file, there
shall be 6 + n*2 such (white-space separated) numbers whose semantics
is explained below. There should not be any other terms in the file
(e.g., comments are not allowed).

The cell is represented as a list of boundary points vert_i_*, each of
which is given in polar coordinates: azimuth angle vert_i_ang and
distance vert_i_dist (aka radius) from the cell's own centre. This
centre is usually cell's geometrical centre but in general it can be
whatever point. This point represents the cell's [0,0] coordinate, the
centre of the cell's coordinate system frame, the cell's centre of
frame.

The position of the cell's centre of frame, however, with respect to
the global coordinates, is given with the (Cartesian!) ini_pos_x and
ini_pos_y coordinates. Basically, one may move/position the cell to
arbitrary location within the global scope with the ini_pos_*
coordinate. Similarly, one may rotate the cell with the ini_rot_ang
parameter (in degrees!)

The cell boundary is simply constructed/approximated by connecting
consecutive boundary points with straight line segments. The last
point on the list is connected with the first one. Note that the list
of vert_i* points MUST BE ORDERED in non-decreasing order with respect
to the angle.

Except for the first four parameters (ini* params), all remaining
lines represent polar coordinate pairs with angles given in radians.

The ini_group_id is either -1 when the cell is not associated with any
group of cell, or it tells ID of a particular group of cells which
this cell is part of.

We distinguish the main orientation of each cell. The orient_ang (in
radians) and orient_dist gives polar coordinate of the head of a
cell's main orientation vector. The cell's centre of frame is the base
of the main orientation vector.
